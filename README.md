# Attention-Based-Visual-Odometry

In this project, we are developing a novel artificial neural network model that can be used to calculate visual odometry. The proposed model is a temporal-based attention neural network, the model takes in raw pixel and depth values from a camera and uses these inputs to generate feature vectors. The model then stores a history of the generated feature vectors, which allows it to take into account the temporal relationship between the current and past data points. 
The resulting output of the model is a prediction of the odometry value, which represents the movement of the camera or object. 
The proposed model has been tested in a variety of scenarios and has shown robust performance in unknown and cluttered environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Install all the requirements (PyTorch v1.13.0)
```shell
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio torchinfo tensorboard
```
2. Clone the GitHub repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/navoday01/ResNet5M-CIFAR10.git
```
3. Change directory into folder
```shell
cd ResNet5M-CIFAR10
```


## üèÅ Quick Start: using Google Colab

To run a demo file go to following google collab link: [test model](https://colab.research.google.com/github/navoday01/ResNet5M-CIFAR10/blob/main/ResnetQuickTest.ipynb)

## ‚è≥ Training
Run train script `ResNetTrain.py` to recreate similar model
```shell
cd models
python3 ResNetTrain.py
```
## üñº Testing

 To Reproduce the accuracy of the model, run `FinalTesting.py` and **ensure the model is on the right folder and change the path in the file.** This script will normalise the images to right value.
```shell
cd models
python3 FinalTesting.py
```
