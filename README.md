# Attention-Based-Visual-Odometry

In this project, we are developing a novel artificial neural network model that can be used to calculate visual odometry. The proposed model is a temporal-based attention neural network, the model takes in raw pixel and depth values from a camera and uses these inputs to generate feature vectors. The model then stores a history of the generated feature vectors, which allows it to take into account the temporal relationship between the current and past data points. 
The resulting output of the model is a prediction of the odometry value, which represents the movement of the camera or object. 
The proposed model has been tested in a variety of scenarios and has shown robust performance in unknown and cluttered environments.

## 📦 Conclusion

A temporal attention (TA) network was created to calculate the visual odometry of the most recent frame using a set of previous frames.

A new dataset called the NYU sparse dataset was created for testing the performance of a visual odometry algorithm in sparse feature environments. The network being tested showed promising results on this dataset and a separate dataset as well. The model's robust performance can be attributed to the fact that the Depth Maps are not being computed but metric Depth Map are taken directly from the dataset, doing this eliminates the scale requirement as it is already encoded in the Depth Map. 

The intent of this project was to create a TA network which was accomplished, further training and testing was conducted on a dataset used in VO benchmarks. Our other goal was to test the model against other state of the art algorithms, to see where it stands. Additionally, the last deliverable was to create a sparse featureless dataset which was also accomplished successfully.
